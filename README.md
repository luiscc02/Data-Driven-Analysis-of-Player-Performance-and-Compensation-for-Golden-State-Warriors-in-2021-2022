The intersection between statistics and sports has created an environment where data-driven decisions significantly evaluate player performance and determine compensation. This project will utilize the Player Impact Plus-Minus (PIPM) method to analyze the on-court values of Golden State Warriors (GSW) players in the NBA. Data on player performance from 2021-22, their championship-winning season, was collected. Moreover, this investigation will aim to derive the Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) of each player in the team, calculated by applying the Scully method to player performance metrics. Comparing these values against player salaries will provide insights for team management and player contract negotiations. In doing so, the report will enhance the ability of various sports franchises to distinguish between player salaries and on-court performances. The results could alter their long-term evaluation strategies and optimize for better team performance.<img width="468" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72981af4-68e9-4390-a3e9-5e60c1cec7ae" />
